### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my Github page! This is Yeni, experience on Data Engineering and also interested in learning data analysis and data visualization. Aiming to be able to give perspectives, stories of the data, and turn it into some insights. Creating some vizzes in Tableau <a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jeni.w4472/vizzes">(see my work here)</a> or in python sometimes. Sometimes I write about data or analysis stuff on Medium <a href="https://medium.com/@jeniiew">(see my writing here)</a>
